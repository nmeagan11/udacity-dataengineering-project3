# Project: Data Warehouse

Redshift hosted database and ETL pipeline for song and user activity for a music streaming app.

## Introduction

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app, and would like to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data currently resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

The purpose of this project is to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on AWS Redshift. To accomplish this, I will load data from S3 to staging tables and run SQL statements to dervie analytics tables from the staging tables.

## Database Design

There are two datasets that reside in S3:

### Song Dataset

The song dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.

### Log Dataset

The log dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings. The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month.

The database is structured as follows:

## Instructions

It is required to set up your own Redshift cluster, IAM role, and IAM user in AWS. Once this is complete, fill out the required information in <code>dwh.cfg</code>. 

Next, run the script <code>create_tables.py</code> to create and define the tables in AWS Redshift.
Finally, run the script <code>etl.py</code> which will process the entire dataset by create staging tables and inserting that data into tables into the Redshift database.
